Problem statement
Given a string of size ‘n’. The task is to delete a minimum number of characters to make string palindrome.

If the given string is “abcda” then we can delete any 2 characters except first and last to make it a palindrome.

If we delete character ‘b’ and ‘c’ then “ada” string is a palindrome

If we delete character ‘c’ and ‘d’ then “aba” string is a palindrome

If we delete character ‘b’ and ‘d’ then “aca” string is a palindrome


Input : aebcbda
Output : 2
Remove characters 'e' and 'd'
Resultant string will be 'abcba'
which is a palindromic string
